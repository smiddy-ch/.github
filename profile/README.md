## What is SMIDDY?

The Swiss Meeting for Infectious Disease Dynamics (SMIDDY) is a one-day meeting focused on mathematical, computational and statistical modeling of infectious diseases. Topics include within-host and between-host dynamics of infectious diseases in both humans and animals.

## Goals of the meeting

The aim of the meeting is to bring together researchers from different fields within Switzerland, ranging from fundamental research to public health policy making. Several research groups will have the opportunity to present their work in a dedicated forum, learn about other projects, and foster future collaborations.

## Founders

SMIDDY was initiated in 2010 by [Christian Althaus](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/althaus_christian/index_eng.html) and Janneke Heijne at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch).
